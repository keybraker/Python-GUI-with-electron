Then, press: 
```
LAUNCH PYTHON CODE
~ this will launch a python application with a loop inside,
  that is waiting for data to be send from js ~
```

And afterwards press: 
```
INTERACT WITH PYTHON CODE
~ this will send a message named "hello" from js to python
  and python will read it and print a message ~
```
And in the end press 
```
TERMINATE PYTHON CODE
~ finally js will send a termination message "exit" to python
  and python will terminate and than js will terminate python
  so that no processes run in the backround ~
```

## Interpretation Guide

After that you should open jsExample.js and pythonExample.js in order to see how the example works and what triggered every message you see in your terminal.
